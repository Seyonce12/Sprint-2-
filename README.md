# Sprint-2-

## Project Description  
This is the implementation of a landing page design for a coffee shop. The page details recommended recipes and provides a brief about the coffee shop.  
It also includes a reservation form with which users can use to make reservations. At the very bottom of the page, the social media links of the shop  
are beautifully placed.  
This project was built using HTML and CSS whiles adhering to industry best practices including the BEM structure and naming conventions.

## Plans for Improvement
I wish to learn how to develop deeper levels of animations like what is used on github and other well-known websites.
